Hi. I'm Paulo. I live in New York and work at [SeatGeek](https://seatgeek.com)

Prior to joining SeatGeek, I worked at [Expedia Group](https://www.expediagroup.com), [BCG](https://www.bcg.com), [ING](https://www.ing.com/Home.htm), and [ECS Capital](https://www.ecs.pt/index.php/en/). I started my career in academia at [Universidade Catolica Portuguesa](http://www.porto.ucp.pt/en/catolica-porto-business-school), [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/economics-and-management/graduate-school), and [Nova School of Business & Economics](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/en/).
