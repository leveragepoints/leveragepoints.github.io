In this interview Katrina Lake, CEO of Stitch Fix, provides a compelling vision for what the next iteration of e-commerce could look like.

>The first version of e-commerce was really this search and filter world. Search and filter is predicated on the fact that you already know exactly what you want. You already know that you want Nike Vaporfly shoes, or you already know that you want a specific style of 7 jeans. Now you want to go and price compare them.

>The first version of the internet was amazing for that. You want to find something cheap and you want it delivered fast. That was exactly what the first version of the internet was meant to do. But if you go back to a search and filter-based platform, of which e-commerce is most of those and just go and type in ‘jeans’. […] The search result would literally deliver millions of pairs of jeans. Then you could sort by color or size. The idea of going from a literal search result of over a million pairs of jeans, to trying to narrow it down to the 4 or 5 that are going to be best for you is an almost impossible task in searching and filtering. I think that old model of search and filter is going to be the way that you find relevant things for you is an impossible solution.
