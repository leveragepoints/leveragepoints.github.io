**How to Operate.**

[Video + transcript](http://startupclass.samaltman.com)

In this lecture, Keith Rabois shares his perspective on how to be an effective manager.

> So one of the most important things I learned at Square is the concept of editing. And this is the best metaphor I have ever seen in 14 years of running stuff, of how to think about your job. It's a natural metaphor, so it's easy to take with you everyday and it's easy to transmit to each of your employees so they can figure out if they are editing or writing. It's a natural construct, you generally know when somebody asks you to do something, am I writing or am I editing?

Managing your attention and information flow is a high leverage point to improve your effectiveness as a manager. Andrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth, Head of AR/VR at Facebook, shares eight practices for improving how to acquire information.

> If you think it is someone else’s job to keep you informed you may be right, but you can take that rightness to the grave for all the good it will do you. The only way to ensure success is to take responsibility for getting the information you need.

**Balancing Advocacy and Inquiry.**

[Book chapter](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/919517/files/28649119/download?wrap=1)

This extract from [The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/163985/the-fifth-discipline-fieldbook-by-peter-m-senge/) provides valuable frameworks and conversational recipes for testing your beliefs through reflection and dialogue.

> Managers in Western corporations have received a lifetime of training in being forceful, articulate "advocates" and "problem solvers." They know how to present and argue strongly for their views. But as people rise in the organization, they are forced to deal with more complex and interdependent issues where no one individual "knows the answer, and where the only viable option is for groups of informed and committed individuals to think together to arrive at new insights. At this point, they need to learn to skillfully balance advocacy with inquiry

## 03. Managing Teams

**Google Guide: Understand Team Effectiveness.**

[Article](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/)

> Much of the work done at Google, and in many organizations, is done collaboratively by teams. [...]

> Following the success of Google’s Project Oxygen research where the People Analytics team studied what makes a great manager, Google researchers applied a similar method to discover the secrets of effective teams at Google. Code-named Project Aristotle - a tribute to Aristotle’s quote, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" (as the Google researchers believed employees can do more working together than alone) - the goal was to answer the question: “What makes a team effective at Google?”

## 06. Productivity

**Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule.**

[Article](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

How you manage your time impacts your effectiveness and the effectiveness of everyone else around you. This essay by Paul Graham highlights the importance of being intentional about how you structure your schedule and your team’s operating rhythm to create both time to manage and time to make.

> There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour. […] But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.

**No meeting Wednesdays.**

[Article](https://blog.asana.com/2013/02/no-meeting-wednesdays/)

One of the best ways I’ve found to create time to think and work has been blocking one day per week without meetings. This practice was inspired by Dustin Moskovitz’s ‘No Meeting Wednesdays’ post. I’ve started doing this a few years ago and typically manage to block at least half a day per week for uninterrupted work.

## 07. Transitioning to a new role

**A Career Cold Start Algorithm.**

[Article](https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start)

> Several times in my career, I’ve joined a team whose work was already well under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure I felt to establish myself and contribute. Over time, I realized that the natural instinct to push for early impact leads many incoming leaders into challenging relationships as they expose their knowledge deficit and waste time. So, I developed an algorithm that has helped me ramp up quickly — and in several cases — have an impact in a relatively short period of time, while minimizing collateral damage.
